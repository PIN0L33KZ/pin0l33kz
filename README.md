# **Hello, I am PIN0L33KZ!** 👋
## About me
 My name is PIN0L33KZ. While it’s simply an online handle, it’s also the name I choose to represent myself in the vast world of the internet. I live in Germany and work as an IT specialist. Beyond my two apprenticeships, I continue to advance my skills with various certifications, including in C# programming and the International Certification of Digital Literacy. Most recently, I earned a certification in the installation, configuration, and administration of the Zammad ticketing software, further expanding my expertise in IT service management solutions.

## **Most recent Projects**
### [Obsidian Panel](https://github.com/PIN0L33KZ/obsidian-panel)
**Obsidian Panel is a modernised continuation of the original MCHostPanel project by Alan Hardman, first introduced in 2016. It provides a sleek, efficient, and self-hosted platform for managing Minecraft servers. Featuring a redesigned web interface focused on usability and performance, it allows administrators to manage files, monitor server performance, and configure game settings with ease, all within a secure and streamlined environment.**
### [Custom CheckMK scripts](https://github.com/PIN0L33KZ/custom_checkmk_scripts)
**This repository contains a collection of custom CheckMK scripts that I have developed to monitor a range of services and components within my network. These scripts extend the functionality of CheckMK, an open-source monitoring solution, by providing tailored checks for specific use cases. They enable administrators to track system health, detect issues, and ensure that critical services remain operational, offering greater flexibility and control over network monitoring tasks.**
### [MCA-ServerConsole](https://github.com/PIN0L33KZ/MCA-ServerConsole "MCA-ServerConsole")
**This application provides a powerful and versatile Minecraft server console, combined with a range of integrated tools for effective server management. It enables administrators to monitor server performance, manage configuration settings, and even create new servers through a streamlined interface. Please note that this project is currently marked as a Work in Progress (WIP), which means certain features may still be under development and subject to change.**
### [Cloudflare DNS Updater](https://github.com/PIN0L33KZ/CloudflareDnsUpdater)
**This program is designed to automatically update your Cloudflare DNS (Domain Name System) record by assigning your current public Internet Protocol (IP) address as the target destination. This process ensures that your domain name always remains correctly directed to your server or network, even in circumstances where your IP address changes due to dynamic allocation by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). By automating this task, the program eliminates the need for manual updates and significantly reduces the risk of downtime or connectivity issues for services hosted on your domain.**
### [Discord RPC Server](https://github.com/PIN0L33KZ/DiscordRPCServer)
**By utilising this program, you will be able to broadcast your Rich Presence status through your Discord client. This feature enables other users to view, in real time, the specific activity you are currently engaged in, such as playing a game or using an application. Rich Presence is a functionality provided by Discord that enhances user interaction, as it offers additional details about the activity, including progress, duration, and, in some cases, interactive options for joining or spectating. This creates a more immersive and connected experience within the Discord platform.**
